<div class="entry-content"><p>I watch my cursed boulder tumble down my mountain. I heave a sigh of relief;
my aching muscles allowed a brief respite. As I stand on its majestic craggy
peak, I survey my mountain beneath me. My boulder is now far out of sight, but
I can feel it down below in the darkness waiting for me. I send my thoughts
out to it &#8211; my boulder you are my work, my affliction, my friend and my
enemy. I shall see you soon enough. In these seemingly countless days,
logically countable but practically indistinguishable, my mind is not always
so clear. At this instant I am aware &#8211; tomorrow I may not be. I grasp the
moment, tenderly. Let me slow it down and take joy in my thoughts. Before my
curse &#8211; I can barely remember &#8211; I took my thoughts for granted. Mortal, I
had a limited amount of time for thoughts, yet I did not enjoy them. Immortal,
and now each thought is precious &#8211; I have forever and thus have infinite
thoughts, yet I take joy in each, insignificant as it is. The absurdity
continues, the one constant along with my rock and my mountain to keep me
company. Yet as I stand there, the cold rare mountain air turning my breath
visible, I am happy.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I remember the moment when first I became fully conscious of my eternal
meaninglessness &#8211; the horror I felt. With time I came to understand that my
previous life, filled with hopes and dreams, was as absurd as my rock and
mountain world. I lied to myself then in order to avoid becoming conscious of
the true nature of existence. Now I have no such luxury, the stark landscape,
unchanging except through my actions, reminds me continually of the futility
of my labor.</p>

<p>Mercury says that Camus once wrote about me, &#8220;His fate belongs to him.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> He
calls me an &#8220;absurd hero.&#8221;<sup>2</sup>Â  I now accept this role. My existence is an
analogy for the futility of rebellion &#8211; there is no escape from the absurd. I
have no hope of completion and no hope of a purpose. Hope would be a lie &#8211; I
can not console myself with lies. In my acknowledgment of my own
ridiculousness I find freedom. I am free to experience, to find joy within
myself or to not, and I am free to create my own happiness, even while I am
not free from the binds of my curse.</p>

<p>Another mortal writes, &#8220;Because there is no absolute certainty to which to
turn, each person must discover ultimate purpose on his or her own.&#8221;<sup>3</sup> Is my
revolt in spite of meaninglessness my purpose? More often than not I get so
caught up in the pure action of my task, nothing else about my condition
matters. However, I have accepted that although the task is itself futile, I
am free to enjoy it. The feeling of my body straining against the massive
weight, navigating the treacherous terrain, my ragged breath, the pulsing of
my immortal heart, these things I look forward to. This world is my creation.
By my actions I define it. It is my flesh and blood and thought, and thus my
purpose.</p>

<p>I listen to my breathing. I start my descent down my beloved hated mountain.
My parting thought at Camus is this: He should not use me as an example of an
&#8220;absurd hero,&#8221; as by that action he gives my existence semblance of meaning.
He takes away my freedom to pursue my own meaning. Is his &#8220;absurdity&#8221; the lack
of knowledge of the bigger context or the knowledge that any bigger context is
meaningless? If the context of my existence is a persistent analogy for
absurdity then it might cease itself to be absurd. Perhaps Camus was simply
ignorant of the larger context of his existence as a tiny thread in the cloth
of existence, locally appearing insignificant but with ripples of continuity
that pervade everything.</p>

<p>Camus maintains that it is an <em>ascesis</em> to be an absurd creator. This I can
understand. I lean into my burden, striving for the purpose of striving or for
the purpose of illustration, either way happy to be reunited with my boulder.</p>
