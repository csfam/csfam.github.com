<div class="entry-content">**Flow, Education, and Ritalin**  
My eyes are glued to the screen. They rarely blink. They become irritated but
I do not notice. I am in the zone. The force is with me. I feel it flow
through me. I am coding. Even though the coding paradigm may not apply to
everyone, we all know that feeling of hyper-attention. When an activity is so
engrossing that the rest of the world fades away, we are left mano-a-mano,
tête-à-tête, our ego and the task battling together for mutual gain.

<!--more-->
  
In positive psychology the term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi to describe
this is "flow". In his seminal work on flow, Csikszentmihalyi uses various
experiential self-report methods to study flow, and he has found some key
techniques that can help in achieving this state. However, he does not mention
the biological mechanisms behind flow. Examining this connection leads to some
interesting findings. If the brain functions during a state of flow include
the brain's attention pathways, then this likely implicates dopamine as one of
the brain chemicals through which flow is experienced. Dopamine is in part not
only responsible for regulating attention but is also the primary
neurotransmitter of reward. Is flow then a state of constant dopamine rush--a
stream of attention and reward causing a physical high? This would explain the
addictive nature of flow. Additionally we could then draw further powerful
conclusions about the utility of flow in our lives. Specifically a
relationship between flow and dopamine suggests further directions of research
relating flow to Ritalin and education. There are thus three main topics to
address in attempting to make a case that more research into this area would
be indispensable:

  1. What are the cognitive pathways involved in flow?
  2. Is dopamine the cause of flow?
  3. Is education a practical application for flow theory?
Understanding how flow happens and how it relates to attention and reward can
be potentially useful in developing new techniques for learning and also can
have broader significance such as in finding non-drug based treatments for
attention disorders.

**What are the cognitive pathways involved in flow?**  
Csikszentmihalyi (1990) defines flow as "an intrinsically motivated, task-
focused state characterized by full concentration, a change in the awareness
of time (e.g., time passing quickly), feelings of clarity and control, a
merging of action and awareness, and a lack of self-consciousness". He claims
that there are eight contributing factors to this feeling (p.49):

  1.  A challenging activity which requires skills
  2.  The ability to concentrate on the task
  3. The task has clear goals
  4. There is immediate feedback
  5. There is deep involvement in the task
  6. There is a perception of control
  7.  Sense of self disappears
  8. Sense of time is altered
The experience of these is so rewarding that people spend their lives in
search of activities that can cause it. Csikszentmihlyi studies flow using a
survey technique he invented called ESM (experiential sampling method). Over
the course of his experiments he has given thousands of participants beepers
that go off at random times during the day. The participants then record what
they are doing and answer a few questions about how they feel. He found that
the conditions necessary for a task to induce flow are that the task is
challenging but that the agent has the requisite skills to undertake it, and
that as the agent performs the task it remains interesting and provides
feedback so that the agent can experience reward. If the task is too difficult
the agent would feel stressed or anxious and if the task is too easy it would
lead to boredom.

Given this definition of flow an analysis can be made of the cognitive tasks
involved. Most of the eight factors are either specific to the domain of the
task (such as the skills required) or are feelings evoked during the activity.
However, two are directly related to a cognitive ability. The ability to
concentrate on the task and to be deeply involved in it requires _attention_.

William James (1890) gives us the most widely used definition of attention:

> It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out
of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.
Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies
withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a
condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained
state which in French is called distraction, and Zerstreutheit
[absentmindedness] in German. (pg. 403)

This definition, in and of itself, is remarkably similar to that of flow. Flow
in part requires a singular type of attention. If all the right circumstances
are present and attention is engaged then flow happens. Neuroimaging has shown
that attention as a cognitive system is spread through several brain areas,
however higher level attention, also called executive control (not simply
visual attention), is located primarily in the frontal cortex (Miller, E. K.,
Cohen, J. D., 2001). Executive control is the system responsible for planning,
initiating behavior, inhibiting inappropriate responses, abstract thinking,
and attentional selection (Goswami, U., 2008). To be able to focus on
something the mind needs to be able to ignore irrelevant stimuli. During flow
the mind also needs to be able to initiate actions and plan the next move. The
effects of time altering and sense of self that Csikszentmihalyi mentions are
both correlated to this part of the brain as well.

**Is dopamine the cause of flow?**  
It has been shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine is part of the attention
regulation system (Nieoullon, A. 2002). Dopamine is one of the primary
mechanisms in the brain's reward circuit and takes part in the inhibitory part
of executive control (pg. 63). Dopaminergic system deficiencies are often
cited as causing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the primary
treatment for ADHD is via drugs such as Ritalin (pg. 57). Ritalin is an
amphetamine derivative and is functionally similar to cocaine (Genetic Science
Learning Center, 2010). Its primary method of action is increasing the levels
of dopamine available in the brain. The principal effect of extra dopamine in
the brain is increased energy and improved attention. However, Ritalin is
often abused not only for the attention enhancing properties but also for the
cocaine like euphoria that can occur at higher doses. Conversely drugs that
treat schizophrenia are dopamine antagonists that by reducing the available
dopamine in the brain also reduce motivation and attention (pg. 72) and even
in some cases prevent all feelings of pleasure (anhedonia) (Surguladze, S. et
all 2002 pg. 451).

There is evidence that dopamine is essential to the mechanisms of creativity,
ideation, and learning. The dopamine pathway increases both arousal and goal-
directedness and at the same time decreases inhibition and suppresses
competing behaviors (Flaherty, A. W., 2005. pg. 149). To confirm the
connection between dopamine and attention, one particular study used Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) scanning -- dopamine receptors were tagged with
radio isotopes and the subjects were asked to perform working memory and
sustained attention tasks. The scans then showed if dopamine receptors were
activated during the tasks and in which brain areas (Aalto, S., Bruck, A.,
Laine,M., Någren, K., Rinne, J. O., 2005). One of the brain mechanisms
involved in all of this is a brain circuit that senses expected and unexpected
rewards and then signals (via dopamine) that we should learn from them (Arias-
Carrión, O.; Pöppel, E. 2007, pg. 486). This system is responsible for not
only gambling addictions but also for much of our unconscious goal-directed
motivation (pg. 484). For instance the dopamine reward and attention circuit
has also been shown to be integral in game playing (Koepp,M.J. et al. 1998).

It would be an oversimplification to say that dopamine alone was responsible
for all the feelings associated with flow. It is, however, fair to say that it
is strongly implicated given its crucial role in attention regulation, reward
and learning. This would suggest that flow is really those moments when the
brain is in a highly attentive state, when it is being rewarded constantly for
each action, and when it is learning at each of those reward moments. What
Csikszentmihalyi is offering in his book is a methodology for creating the
right circumstances to help facilitate this continuous cycle of
expectation/reward/learning that is suggested by the dopamine connection.

**Is education a practical application for flow theory?**  
It is no wonder given the power of flow that Csikszentmihalyi has also turned
his attention to studying flow in educational settings. One of the essential
parts of flow is that the activity is _autotelic_, that is has intrinsic
motivation in and of itself (Csikszentmihalyi, M., 1990, pg. 67). Usually we
start an activity because of an external goal, however as we continue that
activity there is the possibility of starting to enjoy it for its own sake.
That is one of the preconditions for flow and it is also evident in the
learning patterns of toddlers -- for instance a child after just starting to
read will read everything in sight (pg. 130). However in the typical school
system flow is hindered by many factors: the distractions of the classroom,
the uneven skill level of the class, the anxiety inducing difficulty of
certain subjects and the boring simplicity of others. Therein lies the
difficulty of the educational system, how to teach unwilling unmotivated
students material that is either too hard or too easy in a setting that is
distracting.

Csikszentmihalyi proposes that the techniques of flow be used. His first
proposal is that students be given the initial extrinsic motivation by
example. Teachers who enjoy what they do most often have students who also
want that same enjoyment (pg. 133). Given a positive model, the next step is
to match the difficulty of the material with the abilities of the students. In
a large classroom this is a challenge that does not have a ready solution.
Finally, feedback needs to be immediate and learning tasks organized in
attainable steps (pg. 131). Eric Jensen (1995) has this message for teachers:

> Teaching in a way that encourages students to reach the flow state may be
one of the most important roles you have. In this state, learners are highly
internally motivated, and learning becomes enjoyable. Help learners reach flow
by setting up favorable conditions for it. [...] learning will likely be
stifled by a rigid structure. Keep challenge high but stress low. Let learners
set the pace while you provide the support. Have them design a complex project
that is personally relevant, and then vary the resources to keep the task
appropriate to their ability levels. Make it exciting; use teams, simulations,
technology, and deadlines while maintaining the appropriate levels of guidance
[...] (pg. 137).

Hektner and Csikszentmihalyi (1996) say that "in order to maintain the
enjoyment of flow, people must continually engage in new challenges to match
their increasing skills, and they must perfect their skills to meet the
challenges" (p. 4). Csikszentmihalyi then proposes that some of the biggest
_dangers_ to flow are an overemphasis on rules, evaluation, focus on
competition and the ensuing self-consciousness that arises from that
(Csikszentmihalyi, M., 1990, pg. 137). These unfortunately are staples in many
educational systems. Jensen (1995) goes so far as to call these methods _brain
antagonistic_ in his practical book on brain-based teaching (pg. xiii).

It is at this point that dopamine enters the picture. As schools struggle with
students' attentional problems, pharmaceutical companies and modern psychiatry
have provided the answer in the form of dopamine increasing drugs. In 2005, 29
million prescriptions for Ritalin and related drugs were written, nearly 80
percent of them for children (Pettus, A., 2006). Regardless of whether ADHD
medications are over-prescribed or not, it is obvious that a problem exists.

There have been followup studies into flow and learning (Egbert, J., 2003)
showing that flow can exist in classroom settings and that it can be used to
achieve higher rates of self reported interest and energy (Rathunde, K.,
Csikszentmihalyi, M., 2005). In a comparison study of learning states in
traditional versus Montessori schools, Csikszentmihalyi found that optimal
experience (a term used to describe a positive, flow-inducing, learning state)
leads to more _undivided_ interest in the material by the students (pg. 506).
A case may thus be made that flow techniques should be further studied not
only in the context of enhancing the school experience, but that innovative
methodology may be used to alleviate some of the need for amphetamines in
schools.

In 1933, John Dewey suggested that the best state of mind for learning is one
that is "playful and serious at the same time" (p. 286). Today one can
certainly imagine an educational setting where: the material is custom
tailored to each student's ability level, the teacher enjoys the material, and
in which the student, excited to learn, can engage with the material fully to
the point of losing track of time. In a traditional classroom this still seems
difficult to accomplish, even with all the techniques that Csikszentmihalyi
(2005) and Jensen (1995) mention. However there is no technological barrier to
design a system in which students learn through a technology (in a system that
automatically adjusts for difficulty like the one employed by the GRE test)
such that their minds can be optimally activated. Brain antagonistic models of
learning have shown themselves to be problematic at best and in the search for
a new methodology perhaps flow theory can provide some insight into the
problem of attention and motivation in students.

The correlation between flow and dopamine shows us an area ready for further
exploration. If the techniques of flow elicit a type of dopamine high, then
studying these methods may provide answers to attentional disorders. This can
also drive the realization that the mechanisms behind creative passion are
similar to the mechanisms of cocaine addiction, and that can perhaps help find
answers to what pushes people toward one or the other or both. Learning can
and should be _joyful_ (Wolk, S., 2008) and _addicting_, flow and dopamine
shows us a way to make it so.

<div class="entry-content">Instead of writing seriously, I wrote an imaginary interview. BTW:Living in a
van... happened in real life; C.com/"light goop" ...well it was supposed to be
about the future!

**FRAMBERG MAGAZINE INTERVIEW (Issue: March, 2015)**  
**Today we interview Tim Tregubov (age 39),  one of the visionaries behind a small company that might just be changing the way we interact with the world.  C.com is responsible for MultiPhen technology and the company is developing promising new applications that will further integrate adaptive intelligent systems with _the human system_.  The company is being heralded as a forerunner of a new type of business model which they are calling _engaged activism_.   We will find out what makes him tick, what C.com is all about and how it originated.**  

<!--more-->
  
_**Framberg:** So you are one of the founders of C.com? _

**Tim:** Yep. Although it wasn't like we just had a great brainstorming session and out popped a company.  In fact I'd say c.com isn't a company at all, and it is my hope that it never will be!  
It started as just a group of friends pulling allnighters in a computer lab at
college.   We made a good team and had a blast doing it.  Then we all
graduated and got "real" jobs.  We ended up working cold rainy nights sitting
in front of computers in cubicles doing other peoples' bidding.  The good
times were just a memory.  Many years later, we'd get laid-off from our jobs
at the big corporations to be replaced by new dream-filled youth -- youth just
as ready as we were to give up their dreams, creativity and energy in exchange
for job security.

_**Framberg: ** So what happened, that's not the end of the story right?_

Tim: Not at all.  In fact, that never happened!  If it had happened, c.com
never would have even been a twinkle in our eyes. I say this as a warning to
anybody who has had an idea but wants to put it off in favor of making some
money first.  Don't put the golden handcuffs on, rather grab your friends,
grab your idea and sprint out onto the playing field.  If there is one time in
your life when you should do this it is now, not later.

So what really happened was that we kept trying ideas.  My ideas were always a
bit grandiose and self involved but they were cute.  I have always been an
excitable person and tend to dive right into an idea.  Not being a great
swimmer I tend to cannonball.  This sets off lots of waves and people get wet.
Diving right into this analogy -- this would whet their appetite. Sometimes
one of the ideas would spin off an idea wave that we could surf.  This is not
to say all the ideas were mine -- I'm going to get beat up back at the office
for this.

_**Framberg:** Why do you say that c.com isn't a company? What is it?_

**Tim:** c.com is really more of a family.  If you prefer the word company we insist on the older interpretation of the word -- the theater company -- the company of companionship.  The organizational structure of c.com is less of an 'inc' and more of a fellowship.  This sort of company is based around the passion of the founders.  There are no employees per se, everybody is an owner. There is no boss.  We only work on projects we really love. We don't compromise our projects for investors or clients but work for the love of the thing rather than for the monetizing of it.  From the beginning we knew we didn't want to be VC controlled vaporware. What is our mission?  Simple. Create.  
_**Framberg:**  Just to create?  Isn't the company involved in certain
particular areas?_

**Tim: ** It isn't "just"!   We create because it is imperative.  Your readers have perhaps heard of the existential maxim "existence precedes essence."  We have a duty to create the world as we believe it should be. So it isn't just lighthearted play. I believe strongly that once we realize that we are completely responsible for the world, and that by each of our actions we define the world, in part, according to our wishes -- then it becomes clear that our actions do not simply exist in a void and certainly are not just harmless. Quite the contrary.  In fact, every action has meaning and at c.com we strive toward having a socially positive impact on the world.  Every project we undertake has a socially positive foundation.  Whether it is a new educational toy for improving math skills in preschoolers or a social network to promote micro-philanthropy for schools in Ghana, all our projects at their core try to focus on improving the human condition.  
_**Framberg: ** That is quite a philosophical underpinning for a company! Is
this what you call engaged activism? Those sound like lofty ideals, but how do
you manage in practice?_

**Tim:** Yeah, this is definitely a part of _engaged activism_.  When we started we had two main goals. One was to do work which we personally found engaging.  In the lab we would pull allnighters not because we had to but because we were in the zone. We were fully "into" our work. We also enjoyed each others' company.  So our primary motivation was "engaging work with cool people."  
Our second tenet was that our work had to be meaningful.  We wanted to
contribute to society and be able to believe in what we were striving toward.
So our secondary motivation was "socially positive projects that we all could
believe in."  Most importantly we didn't want to simply donate some part of
our profits to good causes, we actually wanted our projects to be good causes
themselves!  If you are working with people you like, on a project you believe
in, and the work itself is rewarding then you are addicted and fulfilled and
happy.

_**Framberg:** What about creature comforts though?  What about money?_

**Tim: ** When we started we all worked for free.  We lived in our parents' basements or at our friends' houses.  We worked nights and we barely scraped by.  We were happy.  I believe that the usual things people work toward, money/fame/success/comfort, can all be side effects of impassioned work.  If we loved what we did and put that love into our work then this would be recognized and appreciated.  This was all secondary to the actual fulfillment of the work itself.  
_**Framberg:**  Are you happier now that you have achieved some success?_

**Tim:**  I wouldn't say that the success has any bearing on my happiness.  I was happy homeless and I am happy now.  We have cooler toys in the office though now, and with the added success we can create better more interesting things.  
_**Framberg:**  Homeless?  Would you like to share that story?_

**Tim: ** [Laughs] In college one summer I lived in a van.  It was my parents' van and I pimped it out so I wasn't exactly being homeless.  I was however a bit persecuted by the campus police and had to park discreetly at night.  Some nights I spent in the Walmart parking lot. I showered at the computer science building, so it was really actually rather comfortable.  
_**Framberg: ** So tell us more about yourself.  When you are not living in a
van what do you do in your free time?_

**Tim:**  Free time?  Mostly I hang out at the studio.  That is what we call the office. I also hike a lot and spend time with the family.  I have an 8 month old daughter, Anki, we hang out at the studio together all the time.  She is a genius in the making I can tell.  Her favorite toy right now is this really expensive prototype "light goop".  It glows and changes color depending on the shape it is in.  It is not yet practical to mass produce, but she loves being the only one in the world with one.  
_**Framberg:** Is that a MultiPhen technology?_

**Tim:**  All of our tech is MultiPhen these days.  
_**Framberg:**  What is MultiPhen exactly?_

**Tim:**  We don't rightly know ourselves.  Actually, it is simply a buzzword I came up with to call our technology.  We were making things that interacted at multiple levels and exhibits multiple phenomenons?   MultiPhen simply sounded cool.   People love buzzwords.<  
_**Framberg: ** We suspected that was the case all along.  It sounds like you
are a bit of a free thinker.  Have you always been a rebel?  Did that help you
get to where you are?_

**Tim:**  I wouldn't say I am a rebel.  [Laughs] I have not had a traditional path though.  My life used to be controlled by fear.  It made me not take the traditional path to college when I should have, instead I tried to start my own web design business after high school and failed.  Then I worked as a programmer for a short while and then as a sysadmin at the college where I eventually started taking classes, and even more eventually graduated from.  That experience changed me quite a bit, I became braver and started moving through life faster.  Went to grad school right after that and started c.com.  
I've learned a lot from my mistakes.  It is unfortunate that wisdom cannot be
taught but must be learned from experience.  I know that my strange background
has helped make me who I am and I do not regret it.  I only wish that I had
gained the wisdom of how to be braver and happier earlier.  I still like to do
things a bit differently, but now it is a choice and partially an affectation
-- I am much less subject to the anxieties that plagued me when I was younger.
This path of discovery, though, made me open to learning and exploring and
playing at points in my life when other people were concentrating on other
things.  I think I was fairly self-restricted as a teen, more so than is
normal, but as the years went by I became more internally free and
rediscovered that play and energy of childhood.  A lot of what I have achieved
has been due to this process of discovery.

_**Framberg:** What is in store in the future for you personally?_

**Tim: ** That is a good question.  More of the same!  In college I took a class that brought up the question of happiness and one thing that we did in the class was identify our main strengths.  My top five strengths were creativity, curiosity, love of learning, energy and appreciation of beauty.  As long as I am able to express my strengths and believe that I am making a positive contribution to the world, then I am happy.   My family, my friends and c.com have enabled me to live the good life so far.  I hope I am up for the challenge of raising my daughter and future little c.com'ers.  That is my next big life challenge.

<!-- figure out how to include excerpt here-->
<div class="entry-content">Is it possible for humanity to consciously direct our own evolution and if so
can we evolve to be better, smarter and faster? Can we evolve ourselves to be
able to sustain an utopic society? In my intro to psychology class one of the
professors told the following story. A professor experimented on his own
newborn by reading Greek poetry to him. He read the same couple of paragraphs
to him every day until the infant was six months old and then stopped. When
the boy turned ten his father started having him memorize Greek passages. He
counted how many repetitions the boy would need to fully memorize a passage
and found that those paragraphs that the boy had previously been exposed as an
infant required half the repetitions that the new passages took. This story is
anecdotal and would require a better designed longitudinal study to prove,
however it was inspirational for me and one of many such stories in that class
that convinced me to change my major from computer science to cognitive
science. I learned in that class that if we utilize the power of our learning
brains, the possibilities for achievement both individually and as a society
could be endless. I became fascinated with the question of how we can harness
our learning, and specifically how technological solutions could be combined
with cognitive science research to take learning to new levels.

This may sound hyperbolic, and indeed such thoughts can lead to Matrix-like
imaginations of possibilities. In my case they often do. However, back on
planet earth, this interest guided me to take a digital electronics class to
learn how to make electronic toys, child development classes to learn how
memory develops, computer science classes for implementation, and education
classes to learn about what is being done in this field. I also started
thinking about various experiences in my life through the lens of this
interest. I would like to write about a few of these experiences and how they
all contributed to my interest in this subject.

Several summers ago I spent a month in Russia. My parents are from Moscow and
on a whim I decided to go there to discover my roots. One of my goals was to
visit parts of Moscow that my parents had told me about. This meant that I
spent a lot of time on the subway going from place to place, taking pictures
and meeting people. One experience on the subway changed how I thought about
public education. The Moscow subway is one of the deepest in the world --
designed to function as a bomb shelter. This meant the escalator rides were
steep and long. Along the way there was a city wide public announcement system
that spouted such epitaphs as: "Protect the heritage of your Russian roots.
Love the language of Pushkin and don't swear" and "Be kind to people. They
deserve your respect as you do theirs". I was astounded at the blatant social
brainwashing and quickly learned to disdain the announcements. Later on the
subway a large group of rowdy teens came into the car. At the next stop a few
older people stepped onto the train and none of the teens moved. A bit later
an announcement came on, "Be nice to those older or weaker than you. Give your
seat to the elderly or to those with young children." At the very next stop
when some older people again came onto the car. This time however a few of the
teens got up and let them sit down. I doubt they realized why they did this as
even I had started blocking out the announcements.

I was confused after seeing this. Moscow was dirty and people were mean. They
needed this basic sort of public education which their parents weren't able to
offer because they themselves did not know it. Was this a dystopian brain-
washing or was it an example of proper use of educational policy because it
was for a social good? I was surprised how strongly I was affected by this
seemingly small incident. I realized that an societal educational system must
burden itself with teaching how to live in society and that society can be
improved by this. However, at the same time it must walk a very careful line
and not cross over into brain-washing. What is the role of education in
society? This is not an easy question, but it does bear thinking about.

After my Moscow trip I had the opportunity to teach a few high-school students
Russian. This was quite possibly one of the most rewarding things I have ever
done. I had never taught before and approached it with a lot of energy, or so
I thought. The students outpaced my energy level by orders of magnitude. They
would jump to answer questions, blurting out answers and giggling with
excitement. They were learning Russian for the fun of it, as it was not
offered at their school and they just wanted to learn for themselves. It was
inspirational to watch them and a rush to be needed by them, to be the source
for their excitement, to be wrung dry by their questions. I am sure I learned
a lot more from this experience than my students.

Moving closer to home, I have a three year old niece who is unbelievably adept
on the computer. Not only does she have the physical coordination for moving
the mouse and the knowledge of how to drag windows and files around but she is
addicted to starfall.com. This site is a free educational site for kids. It
has fun songs and graphics with a myriad of different exercises. She spends
hours on the site. She knows her alphabet, can count fairly well, and has a
great vocabulary. All of this without any pressure from her parents and, since
she is too young for even pre-school, no school. When I was her age my mom
would read to me certainly and we would do a little bit of alphabet work in
Russian, but it was a struggle for both of us. What amazes me so much is how
much time and effort she is more than willing to put in herself. She would
rather play alphabet games on starfall than play with her toys. This is
because the learning is a game in itself. Since she plays on the adult's
computer she gets to play with a toy that belongs to her parents. Often she
will exclaim, "I go work on starfall now!". She may use the word 'work' but
she very clearly enjoys it (most likely she uses that word because her parents
will often 'work' on the computer).

That a three year old is so interested in the animated colorful world of a
computer game should come as no surprise. For me, watching her enjoy learning
and easily grasping letters and numbers really underscores the potency of
technology as a learning tool.

These few small experiences along with many others have all contributed to my
interest in learning with technology. The digital electronics class I took
this summer was perhaps the most fulfilling class I have ever taken. In groups
of two we designed and built an electronics project from scratch. My interest
in learning informed our choice of project. We were toying with the idea of
using an accelerometer (a chip for detecting motion) somehow, and I was
thinking of various toys that could be reinvented digitally. For instance the
tilt-maze game is both ubiquitous and yet also not very interesting. Once you
have the dexterity to beat it you might as well throw it out. How much more
interesting would it be if you had to solve a moving maze and also take the
shortest path through it for points based on the least number of steps taken.
We implemented this game on a small eight by eight matrix of multicolor led
lights. When it came to designing the levels for the game we realized that
there were many more possibilities than we originally envisioned. The maze
could appear to be a multicolor fire spewing dragon with a particular precious
stone on his tail that is the target of the level, or it could be man eating
plants that open in a certain sequence. Designing, programing and building
this game was challenging and we stayed up many late nights. At the same time
it was extremely fulfilling and made me very happy. By the end of the class we
had a working game that people enjoyed playing and which also had an
innovative brain puzzle aspect to it.

All these stories may appear disjointed, but the connection is that they all
spurred my interest in new technologies for education. This leads to an
interesting question: since I put a lot of effort into this interest and am
contemplating grad school in related areas, does it make me happy? Mostly it
has entailed work, exams, projects and sleep loss. On the other hand, just
thinking about some of the possibilities ahead stirs up a great excitement in
me.

I am convinced that this area can use a lot of work. For instance the area of
math education is a prime choice for new ideas. I grew up with a math phobia
in grade school. My teachers were terrible, using performance pressure and
boring teaching to induce fear in their students. However, it is possible to
have fun with math without the pressure and competition that seems to often
lead to math phobia. One current research project that might help is siftables
(www.sifteo.com). These are little cubes that can display letters, colors and
number and react to each when in close proximity. Kids can play with the
blocks that change and interact as they move them. A math game with siftables
could display numbers and math operands and react as students move the blocks
to form equations. Tangible media such as this has huge potential. The fact
that this area is growing and new is exciting.

Still, exciting is not necessarily happy. In my case however, simply being
creatively busy does make me happy. My parents are both artists and when I was
growing up I remember in the evening after a late European style dinner ending
around 10pm my dad would say, "ok I'm going downstairs to work some more." I
grew up in a house where it was never OK to not have a project going. Now I
find that I am unable to simply do nothing. Even when on vacation I have a
hard time relaxing without some purpose tugging at me. I have noticed that
during those times when I don't have a project in the works, I not only feel
useless but almost physically feel sick. This is the antithesis of happiness.
Thus being busy with projects in an area I am interested (especially one that
can bring inspiration and learning to others) brings me a lot of joy.

It appears that a common thread ties together a lot of my recent college
experiences. It has emerged slowly and is still not completely formed, but at
least right now I feel a pulling that gives me a direction to work toward.
This will most likely all change as I gather new experiences, but for now I
enjoy it.
