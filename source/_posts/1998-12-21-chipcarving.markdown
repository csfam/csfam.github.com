(Carving a simple frame out of butternut. Swallowtail shaped chips allow for more intricate designs)

I used to do a lot of chip carving. This is a style of woodcarving found in traditional folk art around the world.  Geometric patterns composed of 2, 3, or 4 sided pyramid shaped chips are carved out of the surface, usually with a single knife.  Each chip comes out as a single piece. It can be used to decorate large building surfaces as well as more intricate pieces such as boxes or art frames.

Here are some samples of my carvings. Most of these are carved in butternut.  Not all are chip carvings -- there are celtic knot style as well as some relief work.
