For the "flagship" engineering class my group designed and built a self-cleaning drain. It was a small device that would retrofit in your shower drain and was foot powered to help clear clogged drains.  By the end of the course we had a working, tested prototype.  My contributions were the SolidWorks design, rapid prototyping, and some of the machining work. The course game me engineering experience outside of electronics and computer engineering. (skills: SolidWorks, rapid prototyping on an Object Eden, lathe and mill machining)
