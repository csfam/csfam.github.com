The current project I am working on is an iPad game that teaches basic rules of chess in a fast paced not-quite-chess environment. The game is a small, but fun combination of space invaders and chess.  It teaches and drills the basic movement rules while remaining engaging. (skills: C#, Unity3D, Maya, Inkscape)
