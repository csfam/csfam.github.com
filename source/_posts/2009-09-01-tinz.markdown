My digital electronics class was perhaps the most fulfilling class I have ever taken.  In groups of two we designed and built an electronics project from scratch.  We reinvented the original tilt-maze game as a digital moving maze on an RBG 8x8 LED matrix controlled via accelerometer.  Our maze designs included a multicolor fire-spewing dragon, a volcano, and an alien space ship with lasers.  People enjoyed playing the game and we were asked to come back to demo it at various Engineering School events.  This course bestowed me with the core set of skills necessary for building electronics.  (skills: VHDL FPGA programming, digital electronics, accelerometers)
